# Changelog

**English** · [简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

All notable user-facing, compatibility, security, operations, and packaging
changes are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and released versions follow semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added weekly dependency update coverage for Rust, Go, Dart/Flutter,
  containers, and GitHub Actions, plus pull-request dependency review.
- Added bilingual changelogs and expanded contributor, security, architecture,
  operations, build, self-hosting, and user documentation.

### Changed

- Bounded signaling connection and rendezvous counts, inbound traffic,
  pairing-limiter state, queued entries, and outbound bytes at the applicable
  process, source-address, Host, lookup, and connection scopes.
- Made signaling heartbeat liveness single-flight with correlated
  acknowledgements across Host, pairing, and Controller-session links; bounded
  client connection/shutdown work and Host WebSocket I/O.
- Reworked macOS permission refresh into a bounded backoff flow and hardened
  installed-package integrity checks.
- Made CI dependency resolution reproducible with enforced Pub lockfiles,
  locked Cargo operations, read-only Go modules, and clean-tree checks.

### Security

- Pinned third-party CI actions and container base images to immutable commits
  or digests, and restricted the Docker build context to the two required Go
  source trees.
- Added fixed inbound traffic and memory-state budgets, bounded shutdown and
  WebSocket work, stricter trusted-proxy parsing, and TLS 1.2 minimums to the
  signaling service.
- Hardened local caches and exports with byte limits, corrupt-record handling,
  symlink rejection, exclusive destinations, secret zeroization, and explicit
  Android cloud/device-transfer exclusions.

### Fixed

- Closed stale asynchronous IPC, pairing, signaling, renderer, data-channel, and
  peer work without allowing it to publish after its owner was disposed.
- Preserved authenticated ICE recovery across answer/candidate races and made
  shutdown continue when one native cleanup operation fails.
- Closed mobile control on backgrounding, returned to the previous page after
  resume, and shielded iOS task-switcher snapshots.
- Stabilized mobile control locking, safe-area placement, and keyboard dismissal.
- Replaced the unpublished iOS App Store link with the source-build guide and
  corrected the QR pairing instructions in the in-app About page.
- Prevented concurrent diagnostics exports from selecting and overwriting the
  same destination file.
- Kept valid heartbeat acknowledgements correlated under heavy pairing relay
  traffic instead of evicting the pending request from bounded history.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Added in-app project, installation, and companion-device guidance.
- Added a control-lock mode for a more immersive mobile remote viewport.

### Changed

- Persisted the iOS export-compliance declaration used by archive distribution.
- Refined macOS companion setup and Settings presentation.

### Fixed

- Kept the macOS protected-session control indicator non-activating and made its
  local Stop interaction more reliable.
- Corrected Settings hover shape and removed an unwanted menu tooltip.

Version 1.0.1 supersedes 1.0.0. The published artifact is a Developer ID-signed,
Apple-notarized, stapled macOS package for macOS 14.4 or later.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- First public source release of account-free QR and desktop-code pairing with
  Host-local approval and persistent one-way grants.
- Authenticated WebRTC screen/control sessions, bounded reconnect, local Stop,
  grant revocation, and privacy-safe diagnostics.
- Source implementations for Windows/macOS Host and Controller roles plus
  iOS/Android Controller roles.
- Self-hostable in-memory signaling and STUN-only Docker Compose profile.
- Signed, notarized, and stapled macOS 14.4+ installer package.

This release contains known issues and is retained only for version history. Do
not install it; use 1.0.1 or a later release.
