# Official signaling and STUN profile

**English** · [简体中文](official-infrastructure-plan.zh-CN.md)

The current official service profile uses account-free signaling plus public STUN:

- Signaling: `wss://signal.hcl.life/v1/connect`
- STUN: `stun:stun.hcl.life:3478`
- ICE policy: `all`
- TURN relay: not provided

Signaling is WebSocket traffic and may be routed through an HTTP reverse proxy.
STUN is UDP traffic and must be exposed through direct DNS or a compatible
layer-4 load balancer. A URL path such as `https://hcl.life/stun/` cannot carry
STUN, and an ordinary website CDN does not replace UDP 3478.

## Deployment boundary

The public client may contain official domain names and ports. It must not
contain an infrastructure credential, private key, origin address, SSH alias,
certificate path, or operator-specific local path. STUN has no password and
does not relay session traffic.

WSS terminates at signaling, so the operator can access the bounded nested
envelope bytes being forwarded, including public identity proofs and WebRTC
negotiation metadata, as well as source addresses, registered routing
identifiers, timing, and traffic size. The current service does not decode,
persist, or normally log nested bodies, but that data-minimizing implementation
is not end-to-end confidentiality from its operator. Access to proxy, runtime,
and infrastructure telemetry must also be restricted. The repository defines
no uptime or support SLA for the official profile; deployments that require
operator-controlled availability should use the self-hosting profile and their
own monitoring.

The signaling process listens on a private interface behind the reverse proxy.
The proxy overwrites `X-Real-IP`, and the service trusts that header only when
the direct peer belongs to `SIGNALING_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`. Never configure the
whole Internet as a trusted proxy.

## Release readiness

Before presenting the profile as generally reliable:

1. Verify WebSocket Upgrade, the required Protobuf subprotocol, disabled proxy
   buffering, bounded timeouts, and no CDN caching.
2. Verify UDP 3478 from an independent public network; a local STUN health check
   is insufficient evidence for cloud firewall rules.
3. Monitor signaling health, process restarts, rejected pairings, bounded client
   reconnects after missing correlated heartbeat acknowledgements, certificate
   expiry, and STUN availability without logging identifiers, session payloads,
   or network mappings.
4. Automate certificate renewal and deploy only a recorded signaling source
   revision or verified artifact.
5. Test installed macOS and Windows Hosts with physical iOS and Android
   Controllers across separate public networks.
6. Present a clear failure when direct ICE cannot connect. Do not imply that
   STUN can traverse every NAT.
7. Publish an operator-specific privacy notice before using this profile in a
   general distribution. It must identify the operator and monitored contact,
   data categories and purposes, infrastructure providers, actual log/backup
   retention, deletion and user-request paths, and its effective date. The
   technical security guide is not a substitute, and unknown operational facts
   must remain release blockers rather than assumptions.

Presence, pairing rendezvous, rate-limit windows, and active routes live in one
signaling process and are cleared on restart. A single instance is acceptable
for the initial service; horizontal scaling requires shared routing/state or a
message bus rather than independent replicas behind a load balancer.

## Client integration

Release builds include a restorable official profile and a runtime custom
profile for signaling and STUN. The selected profile is passed to the GUI-owned
Host Agent. Developers may continue to run signaling, the Host Agent, and
Flutter independently with explicit environment or Dart definitions.

Changing a Host signaling endpoint restarts its GUI-owned Agent. Previously
paired Controllers continue to hold the old endpoint until an authenticated
re-pairing replaces the binding for the same Host identity. STUN settings are
local ICE inputs and are not embedded in pairing QR codes.

## TURN relay boundary

TURN is deliberately outside the current official profile because it relays
high-bandwidth encrypted traffic and needs abuse controls, allocation limits,
capacity monitoring, and short-lived credentials. Any separately operated TURN
deployment should use a direct DNS name or layer-4 load balancer and must never
embed a long-lived TURN password in the client.
