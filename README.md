**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Roammand turns your phone, tablet, or another computer into a trusted control surface for the Windows and macOS machines that carry your work. Pair directly with your own devices, reconnect without an account, and stay in control wherever you are.

Continue desktop work from mobile, supervise long-running tasks, and keep your personal computing environment within reach.

## Platform support and downloads

The source tree implements all four platform roles below, but only the macOS
package is currently published as a general-download binary. Source targets and
release availability are intentionally shown separately.

| Platform | Role | Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 14.4 or later | Host and Controller | [Signed and notarized `.pkg` from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MisakiHCL/roammand/releases/latest/download/Roammand.pkg) |
| Windows 10 / 11 | Host and Controller | Source build and packaging scripts; installed-Host acceptance is currently defined for Windows 11; no public binary |
| iOS / iPadOS 13 or later | Controller | Source build or maintainer-invited testing; no public App Store download |
| Android 7.0 or later (API 24) | Controller | Source build; no public binary |

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/MisakiHCL/roammand/releases) for
previous macOS packages and asset digests. Source-built and invited mobile
builds are intended for development and target-device verification until a
public mobile release is listed here.

## Quick start

1. Install Roammand on the Host Mac and open **This computer**. Use another
   installed Mac, a source-built Controller, or an invited mobile build on the
   controlling device.
2. Complete the Screen Recording and Accessibility setup shown by the app. The
   Host stays unavailable until both permissions are ready.
3. For a phone or tablet, scan a live QR invitation and approve the named
   Controller on the Mac. For another computer, enter the one-time desktop code,
   compare all four English verification words, and then approve it on the Host.
4. The Mac appears in **My computers**. Choose **Connect** whenever you want to
   continue working remotely.

See the [user guide](docs/user-guide/README.md) for installation, permissions,
pairing, connection limits, and uninstalling.

## What you can do

- Pair a phone from a live QR invitation with Host-local approval, or pair
  another computer with a one-time code and four-word verification.
- Save trusted computers and reconnect without pairing again.
- Control Windows and macOS from iOS, Android, Windows, or macOS.
- Use touch gestures, text, modifiers, and special keys from mobile.
- Recover from temporary interruptions with bounded, authenticated reconnect.
- See who is connected, stop control locally, and revoke any Controller from the Host.
- Export privacy-safe diagnostics and run your own signaling and STUN services.

## Current limits

- A Host accepts one inbound Controller session and shares its main display;
  multi-display selection is not available.
- Audio, clipboard synchronization, file transfer, cloud sync, and automatic
  updates are not included.
- Mobile control is foreground-only. The current iOS/iPadOS interface is
  landscape-only, and backgrounding closes the session.
- The public and included self-hosting profiles have no TURN relay, so direct
  ICE can fail on restrictive networks.
- Protected lock/login control requires the installed Host components and the
  operating system's permissions and policies. Cold access before the owner has
  logged in, continued control after full logout/Host exit, and FileVault
  preboot are outside the supported boundary.
- The repository documents the built-in services' technical metadata boundary,
  but their operator has not yet published a separate consumer privacy policy.
  Self-host the services if you need an operator-controlled policy before that
  disclosure is available.

## How it works

Pairing creates a Host-local, one-way grant after the Host owner verifies and
approves the named Controller. Later sessions authenticate that saved grant
before remote control begins; signaling cannot grant access by itself.

Authorization is one-way: a Controller can access only the Host that approved it. Reversing the direction requires a separate pairing and approval.

## Start from source

Install the pinned toolchains and workspace dependencies:

```bash
make bootstrap
make app-check
```

These workflows hide successful tool output and print one final `[PASS]` line. If a workflow fails, it prints a short error tail. Add `VERBOSE=1` to stream the complete output, for example `make app-check VERBOSE=1`.

With the built-in official signaling and STUN services, start only the desktop
app:

```bash
make app-run-macos
```

That command prepares native WebRTC, incrementally builds the Debug Host Agent,
and lets the desktop GUI start and stop it. To test a phone Controller, use a
second terminal for the mobile app:

```bash
cd apps/client_flutter
flutter devices
flutter run -d YOUR_IOS_DEVICE_ID --no-pub
# Or: flutter run -d YOUR_ANDROID_DEVICE_ID --no-pub
```

`-d` takes the exact device ID listed by `flutter devices`; `ios` and
`android` are platform names, not reliable physical-device selectors.

This path needs only the desktop and mobile app processes; the official profile
does not require a local signaling terminal. Installed Release builds need no
terminal. See [Building Roammand from source](docs/BUILDING.md) for
self-hosting, guarded plaintext `ws://` debugging, platform prerequisites,
Release builds, and Host packaging.

Desktop and mobile apps expose the same Network services settings for signaling
and STUN. The official profile can always be restored. This release attempts
direct ICE connections and has no TURN relay fallback, so restrictive networks
may still fail to connect.

## Security by design

- No cloud account is required.
- Long-term private keys and device grants remain on the devices.
- Pairing creates a permanent grant only after Host-local approval.
- Signaling cannot authorize control. The current service forwards bounded
  nested protocol bytes without decoding or persisting them; this implementation
  property does not make those bytes confidential from the service operator.
- WebRTC protects screen and input traffic between the peers. A signaling
  operator can access forwarded negotiation bytes, public identity material,
  and routing metadata; STUN exposes the mapping request's source address and
  timing. Account-free does not mean metadata-free or anonymous.
- The Host keeps control visible and exposes local Stop and Emergency stop.
- Input is released and blocked while a session is recovering or changing graphical sessions.
- Diagnostics exclude device identities, network addresses, SDP/ICE, input, screen data, credentials, and raw payloads.

Read the [pairing model](docs/architecture/account-free-pairing-v1.md), [privileged session bridge](docs/architecture/privileged-session-bridge-v1.md), [threat model](docs/security/privileged-helper-threat-model.md), and [diagnostics policy](docs/security/privacy-safe-diagnostics.md) for the exact boundaries.

## Self-hosting

Roammand includes a pinned Docker Compose deployment for signaling and
STUN-only coturn. It runs non-root services with file-backed TLS secrets,
health checks, a single UDP STUN port, and bounded logs. Signaling state is
single-instance and in memory, and the included profile has no TURN relay. See
[Docker Compose self-hosting](docs/self-hosting/docker-compose.md).
