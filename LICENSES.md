# Licensing

Roammand is a multi-license repository. There is no single repository-wide
license: the destination path and the file's SPDX identifier determine the
terms for project-authored material.

| Path | License |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/client_flutter/` | Mozilla Public License 2.0 |
| `crates/` | Mozilla Public License 2.0 |
| `services/signaling/` | GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 only |
| `schema/` | Apache License 2.0 |
| `gen/` | Apache License 2.0 |
| `conformance/` | Apache License 2.0 |
| `docs/`, root public documentation, and `brand/*.md` | Apache License 2.0 |
| Project-authored `infra/`, `packaging/`, and `scripts/` files carrying an Apache-2.0 SPDX identifier | Apache License 2.0 |

Full license texts are stored in `licenses/`. Project-authored source files carry the matching SPDX identifier; generated scaffolding inherits the license of its component path.

Unless a file or contribution states otherwise, ChengLong Hu holds the
copyright in Roammand project-authored material and licenses that material
under the path-specific terms above. Third-party and other contributor rights
remain with their respective holders.

A third-party file, generated artifact, or embedded notice keeps its own terms
even when located under one of these paths. The Roammand visual brand artwork
under `brand/`—excluding the Apache-2.0 guide text—and its generated visual
derivatives are original works created by and copyrighted by ChengLong Hu.
Their use in official Roammand source and binary distributions is authorized,
but that inclusion does not grant a standalone trademark right or a separate
open-source license for the artwork. Ask the rights holder before independently
redistributing the artwork or using the Roammand name or marks to identify,
endorse, or promote another product.

Dependencies and bundled third-party assets retain their own licenses. A component license does not replace third-party notices.

## Dependency inventory and release notices

The dependency tables below highlight native, cryptographic, pairing, and
bundled assets that need special attention. They are **not** an exhaustive
third-party notice report. Resolution and integrity inputs include:

- `Cargo.lock` for Rust;
- `apps/client_flutter/pubspec.lock` and the Apple `Podfile.lock` files for
  Flutter and CocoaPods;
- each Go module's `go.mod` and `go.sum` files;
- the checked hashes and embedded `LICENSE.md` files from native WebRTC archives.

Cargo, pub, and CocoaPods lockfiles record selected versions and integrity
inputs. A Go `go.sum` is a checksum history, not an exact inventory of the
currently selected module graph; derive that graph from each module (for
example, with `go list -m -json all`). None of these inputs substitutes for
license texts or attribution. Before distributing an application, installer,
container, or hosted modified signaling service:

1. Generate a complete software bill of materials and third-party notice list
   from the exact locked graph and the artifacts actually shipped.
2. Review direct and transitive packages, the Flutter engine/embedders,
   CocoaPods, native WebRTC archives, container base images, and bundled assets.
3. Include every required license, notice, attribution, source offer, and
   modification notice in the distribution or accompanying source location.
4. Treat an unknown or incompatible license and a missing required notice as a
   release blocker.

The baseline package allowlist stages project license texts and the fetched
native WebRTC archive notices. The macOS release workflow then derives the
artifact-specific records described below; the baseline allowlist alone must
not be interpreted as a complete transitive notice set or SBOM.

## Artifact-specific release compliance

Every published macOS version must provide release-specific compliance
materials derived from the exact final package:

- `SBOM.spdx.json`, an SPDX 2.3 software bill of materials with a SHA-256
  inventory of the staged payload;
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, containing the collected notices, attributions, and
  license texts required for that package; and
- `SOURCE_CODE.md`, recording a public source URL pinned to the exact release
  tag and immutable commit.

These materials must accompany the macOS release assets or be linked from the
release to a stable public location. A package manifest, an SBOM from another
platform, or this overview is not a substitute. Missing or invalid material
blocks publication of that macOS version.

The macOS staging and signing workflows generate these three files from the
locked Cargo, Dart/pub, CocoaPods, Flutter, and native WebRTC inputs. Signing
regenerates them before the final install manifest so their payload hashes
describe the signed files. Generation stages the complete output set before
replacement, and the packaging gate rejects an incomplete or inconsistent set.
CI additionally validates the SPDX document with pinned `spdx-tools` 0.8.5.

iOS and signaling/server releases have separate dependency graphs, artifacts,
distribution channels, and compliance records. Generate and review their SBOM,
third-party notices, source link, and any applicable source-offer or
modification notices independently; neither release line inherits compliance
approval from macOS or from the other release line.

## Highlighted WebRTC dependencies

| Dependency or asset | Upstream license/notice location | Distribution note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `flutter_webrtc` 1.5.2 | `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` in the resolved pub package | MIT, with additional upstream notices that must accompany redistributed binaries as applicable |
| `libwebrtc` 0.3.27 Rust wrapper | Fixed-revision LiveKit `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and `webrtc-sys/NOTICE.md` retained by the macOS compliance generator | Apache-2.0; preserve the LiveKit, WebRTC patch, arcas-io, Sora, and Unity notices selected for the locked crate revision |
| Pinned native WebRTC archives | `LICENSE.md` inside each archive fetched by `scripts/fetch_libwebrtc.sh` | WebRTC BSD-style terms plus included third-party terms; reproduce applicable notices with binary distributions |

The native WebRTC archives are downloaded from the pinned upstream release and are not committed to this repository. Their release tag and SHA-256 values are recorded in `scripts/libwebrtc-assets.sha256`. Packagers are responsible for preserving the complete upstream `LICENSE.md` from the exact archive they redistribute.

## Highlighted pairing dependencies and assets

| Dependency or asset | Upstream license/notice location | Distribution note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BIP-39 English word list | `conformance/wordlists/NOTICE.md` | MIT; vendored unchanged with a pinned SHA-256 for four-word SAS interoperability |
| Dart `cryptography` 2.9.0 | `LICENSE` in the resolved pub package | Apache-2.0 |
| Rust `aes-gcm` 0.10.3 and `hkdf` 0.12.4 | License metadata and files in the resolved Cargo packages | Apache-2.0 OR MIT |
| Rust `x25519-dalek` 2.0.1 | License metadata and files in the resolved Cargo package | BSD-3-Clause |
| Dart `mobile_scanner` 7.2.0 | `LICENSE` in the resolved pub package | BSD-3-Clause; preserve notices in redistributed mobile binaries |
| Dart `qr_flutter` 4.1.0 | `LICENSE` in the resolved pub package | BSD-3-Clause |
| Dart `flutter_secure_storage` 10.3.1 | `LICENSE` in the resolved pub package | BSD-3-Clause |
| Dart `device_info_plus` 13.2.0 and `path_provider` 2.1.6 | `LICENSE` in each resolved pub package | BSD-3-Clause |
| Dart `url_launcher` 6.3.2 and `package_info_plus` 10.2.1 | `LICENSE` in each resolved pub package | BSD-3-Clause |

The BIP-39 notice is committed at
[`conformance/wordlists/NOTICE.md`](conformance/wordlists/NOTICE.md). Version
numbers above describe the locked dependency graph at the time this overview
was updated; release tooling must derive its inventory from the ecosystem's
selected graph and the artifacts actually shipped rather than relying on this
prose.

This file summarizes repository intent and does not replace legal review for a
particular distribution or hosted deployment.
